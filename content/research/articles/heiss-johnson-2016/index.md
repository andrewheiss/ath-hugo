## Abstract

Recent scholarship works to open the "black box" of international non-governmental organizations (INGOs), explaining their activities without conventional assumptions of altruism and high-mindedness. We review *Borders Among Activists* by Sarah Stroup, *The Opening up of International Organizations* by Jonas Tallberg, et al., and *Internal Affairs* by Wendy Wong and pinpoint how each book makes important contributions to understanding the determinants of INGO activities. After developing an organizing framework that permits careful analysis of the internal, interactive, and institutional factors that influence policy outcomes, we demonstrate the merits of the framework by applying it to each book. We evaluate each work's contributions to individual layers in the framework, locating each book within its intended scholarly context. We identify ties between books, examining how each work implicitly treats the other layers of our framework. The conclusion identifies a new research agenda for INGO studies and outlines promising avenues for future INGO scholarship.

## Important figures

Figure 1 from the paper, showing a unified framework for understanding the types of influences on INGO behavior and policy outcomes. The triangular shape conveys the specificity of the layers: from narrow "micro" phenomena at the internal layer to much wider "macro" phenomena at the institutional layer.
