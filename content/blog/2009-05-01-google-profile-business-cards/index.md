Awesome :)

Google is giving packs of 25 of these away for free to promote their new [Google Profiles](http://www.google.com/profiles/andrewheiss "Andrew Heiss - Google Profile") service. I think the profile idea is greatâ€”it makes finding people online so much easier and [gives you more control over what Google says about you.](http://lifehacker.com/5221323/google-profiles-give-you-control-over-what-google-says-about-you "Lifehacker - Google Profiles Give You Control Over What Google Says About You - Google Profiles")

Too bad I won't get these until August when my mother-in-law comes to visit.
