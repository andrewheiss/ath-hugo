**knitr** and R Markdown are essential parts of my academic writing workflow, and they make it really easy to write in one file format and then convert it to whatever output I need. When knitting to PDF, plots are all vector-based with selectable text, and math equations are all done in beautiful LaTeX. When knitting to HTML, plots are PNG files (since HTML struggles with cross-browser vector image support), and math equations are all done in beautiful MathJax. It's a wonderful system.

One place where the system struggles, though, is with more complex types of content like TikZ figures. TikZ lets you make all sorts of fancy diagrams and equations, but it's a tricky language and I barely understand it, lol. There are some helpful resources about it, though:

-  [Rachel Menghua Wu](https://rmwu.github.io/)'s crash course to TikZ ([part 1](https://rmwu.github.io/tutorial/latex/2019/08/27/intro/) and [part 2](https://rmwu.github.io/tutorial/latex/2019/11/21/positioning/))
- [Overleaf's guide](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/TikZ_package)
- [Overleaf's tutorial series](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/LaTeX_Graphics_using_TikZ:_A_Tutorial_for_Beginners_(Part_1)%E2%80%94Basic_Drawing)
- [Mathcha](https://www.mathcha.io/) can draw and export diagrams as TikZ, as can [DAGitty](http://dagitty.net/)

Through the magic of **knitr** and R Markdown, it's actually possible to use TikZ chunks directly in an R Markdown document and have them knit to both PDF *and* vector-based SVG files in HTML. Magic!


## Knitting TikZ chunks to PDF

**knitr** has the ability to [use custom engines for rendering other languages](https://yihui.org/knitr/demo/engines/), including TikZ, by including a `tikz` chunk like this:

````text
`r ''````{tikz}
\begin{tikzpicture}
% TikZ code here
\end{tikzpicture}
```
````

To try this out, make a new blank .Rmd file and put this in it:

*(Side note: Syntax highlighting R Markdown files is tricky because they involve so many different possible languages (YAML, Markdown, R, Python, tikz, etc.), but GitHub Gists can highlight them just fine. So all these code chunks here are actually embedded Gists. If you have JavaScript enabled, or if GitHub shuts down Gist some day, or if you otherwise can't see them, you can [see the original gists here](https://gist.github.com/andrewheiss/55f06b079cb7064f2de5b2c174546fae)), or you can see them in the GitHub repository for this website here)*

```{r eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
# Hugo's syntax highlighter struggles with higlighting R Markdown files because
# they involve so many other potential chunks of languages. GitHub can highlight
# them just fine though, so rather than include these Rmd chunks here as plain
# text, I created gists for each of them and embedded them instead. The gists
# are here: https://gist.github.com/andrewheiss/55f06b079cb7064f2de5b2c174546fae

# For the sake of reproducibility (and in case GitHub ever kills Gist in the
# future), these are also each included in this folder as example-1.txt,
# example-2.txt, and so on.
```

<script src="https://gist.github.com/andrewheiss/55f06b079cb7064f2de5b2c174546fae.js?file=example-1.Rmd"></script>

Knit that to PDF and you'll see a neat little diagram of a [directed acyclic graph](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggdag/vignettes/intro-to-dags.html) (or DAG) ([see full PDF here](example-1.pdf)):

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("example-1.png")
```

## Knitting TikZ chunks to HTML as PNGs

If you knit that document to HTML, you'll also see the same diagram, but it will be a low resolution PNG and will look huge and pixelated. Behind the scenes, **knitr** converts the TikZ chunk to PDF and then converts that PDF to PNG and includes it in the HTML file ([see full HTML file here](example-1.html)).

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="70%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("example-1-pixelated.png")
```

There's theoretically a way to change the DPI of this PNG file using the `engine.opts` chunk option and passing additional arguments to ImageMagick, which handles the conversion, but it only causes errors for me (`Error in magick_image_format(image, toupper(format), type, colorspace, : Invalid ImageType value: -density 300`) and I can't figure out why (see [this StackOverflow post too](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51735831/is-it-possible-to-increase-resolution-of-image-inserted-to-word-document-from-rm)) :

````text
`r ''````{tikz, engine.opts = list(convert.opts = '-density 300'), fig.ext="png"}
% Stuff here
```
````

## Knitting TikZ chunks to HTML as SVGs

But even if I could get it to work, PNG files aren't great for vector-like things like TikZ diagrams. It would be great if instead I could convert these diagrams to vector-based SVG files. 

Fortunately **knitr** handles that too! Try this! (Note the `self_contained: no` in the YAML metadata—this will create a standalone DVI and SVG file in a folder named `<NAME_OF_RMD>_files/html-figures/`. You don't technically need this—without it, R will embed the images as base64-encoded text—but to make it easier to see the files R makes, we'll disable it)

<script src="https://gist.github.com/andrewheiss/55f06b079cb7064f2de5b2c174546fae.js?file=example-2.Rmd"></script>

You'll most likely get an error about Ghostscript:

```Text
processing of PostScript specials is disabled (Ghostscript not found)
```

### Connecting `dvisvgm` to Ghostscript on macOS

Unfortunately it takes a little bit of initial setup to get all the moving pieces working for it to happen. To go from TikZ to SVG, **knitr** first converts the `tikz` chunk to DVI and then uses the terminal program `dvisvgm` to convert the DVI to SVG. Getting `dvisvgm` working on macOS is tricky though (and presumably it's tricky on Windows too, but I don't have a Windows machine to test it on).

The most typical way of installing the LaTeX ecosystem on macOS is to install [MacTeX](https://www.tug.org/mactex/), which comes with all the dozens of special utilities TeX uses for typesetting. MacTeX comes with both `dvisvgm` and a special program called Ghostscript that handles text in DVI files. HOWEVER, by default it does not provide a way to have `dvisvgm` and Ghostscript talk to each other (there's [a whole post about it here](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/559640/making-dvisvgm-and-ghostscript-from-mactex-talk-to-each-other)). Ghostscript really is installed, though—`dvisvgm` just can't see it.

To fix it, you actually need to reinstall MacTex and choose a custom installation option. When you get to the "Installation Type" section in the package installation dialog box, click on "Customize" and then make sure the box is checked for "Ghostscript Dynamic Library". By default this is not checked, and I have no clue why, since this is the bridge that you need to get `dvisvgm` and Ghostscript to talk to each other. 

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="70%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("install-mactex.png")
```

Install MacTeX with that option enabled and you'll have a special new file nested deep within your filesystem at `/usr/local/share/ghostscript/9.53.3/lib/libgs.dylib.9.53`. This `libgs.dylib.**` file is the dynamic library that `dvisvgm` needs to know about to work. MacTex 2021 installs Ghostscript 9.53.3, so later versions of MacTex will place `libgs.dylib` somewhere else.

To tell `dvisvgm` where this dynamic library is, you then need to set an environment variable. Open `~/.bash_profile` or `~/.zshrc` or whatever you use for setting your PATH and other terminal settings and add this:

```sh
export LIBGS=/usr/local/share/ghostscript/9.53.3/lib/libgs.dylib.9.53
```

Open a new terminal window and type `print $LIBGS` to verify that the environment variable was actually set. Now you should be able to run `dvisvgm -l` and see an entry for `ps` in it (see [this FAQ page](https://dvisvgm.de/FAQ/) for lots of other details and help for troubleshooting this):

```text
$ dvisvgm -l
...
ps         dvips PostScript specials
...
```

That means everything's working and you should now be able to convert from DVI to SVG!

### Connecting `dvisvgm` to Ghostscript within R

However, RStudio doesn't pick up your shell's environment variables when knitting files, so if you knit the document with `fix.ext='svg'` enabled, you'll still get an error about Ghostscript not being found.

To get around this, you can actually set environment variables from within the R Markdown document itself. Add `Sys.setenv()` to an invisible chunk like this:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/andrewheiss/55f06b079cb7064f2de5b2c174546fae.js?file=example-3.Rmd"></script>

And now everything should work! You'll get an HTML file with a vector-based SVG version of the TikZ figure ([see full HTML file here](example-2.html)):

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="70%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("example-2.png")
```

### Choosing the TikZ output format based on the knitted output

We can now knit this TikZ chunk to PDF if we use `fig.ext="pdf"` and to SVG if we use `fig.ext="svg"` in the chunk options. Remembering to switch these extensions manually, though, is tedious. To make life a little easier, we can create some conditional output types using **knitr**'s (newer?) `opts-template` ability, which lets you create chunk option templates that you can reuse throughout the document. Here, we'll use `fig.ext="pdf"` when knitting to PDF, and `fig.ext="svg"` otherwise. If I could get the TikZ → PNG conversion working nicely, I'd make it use `fig.ext="png"` when knitting to Word, too.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/andrewheiss/55f06b079cb7064f2de5b2c174546fae.js?file=example-4.Rmd"></script>

Now if you knit that file ↑ to PDF, it will create a PDF TikZ image; if you knit to HTML, it will create an SVG image through `dvisvgm`. Magic!

### Font issues

You'll notice that we've only been using text-less TikZ figures as an example so far. TikZ handles text just fine—it processes it through LaTeX and lets you do everything regular LaTeX typesetting does, so you can add fancy equations and Greek letters, etc. to diagrams. Let's add some letters with subscripts:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/andrewheiss/55f06b079cb7064f2de5b2c174546fae.js?file=example-5.Rmd"></script>

When knitting to PDF, this diagram looks great, typeset in Computer Modern like any standard LaTeX document([see full PDF here](example-5.pdf)):

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("example-5-pdf.png")
```

When knitting to HTML, the SVG version of the diagram also works, except for the fonts, since `dvisvgm` doesn't embed the fonts by default ([see full HTML file here](example-5.html)):

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="70%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("example-5.png")
```

If you open the SVG file that R generates (find it at `<RMD_filename>_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.svg`) in something like Illustrator, it will complain about font references that are missing, like `cmmi10` and `cmmi7`:

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("illustrator.png")
```

And if you open the SVG file in a text editor you'll notice references to font names, but those assume that you have fonts named "cmmi7" and "cmmi10" on your computer, which is doubtful:

```xml
...
<font id='cmmi7' horiz-adv-x='0'>
<font-face font-family='cmmi7' units-per-em='1000' ascent='750' descent='250'/>
...
```

### Font solutions

Fortunately there's a solution! `dvisvgm` has an optional flag (`--font-format=woff`) that will embed the special LaTeX fonts using a base64-encoded web-optimized WOFF file, which means the SVG file should show the correct fonts in any modern browser or editor.

However, there's currently not a direct way to use that flag with **knitr**. The command for `dvisvgm` is hardcoded into **knitr**'s code and you can't add any extra arguments (though [I've opened an issue at GitHub](https://github.com/yihui/knitr/issues/2038) about this).

But never fear! There's a neat roundabout way around this!

You can use [special chunk hooks](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/chunk-hooks.html) in **knitr** to run functions before or after chunks are rendered. We can create a function that runs after a TikZ chunk is rendered that takes the temporary DVI file that **knitr** creates and then runs `dvisvgm --font-format=woff` on it, thus overwriting the non-embedded SVG file that **knitr** makes with its hardcoded `dvisvgm` command. Here's one way to do it (which I adapted from [the built-in `hook_png()` function](https://github.com/yihui/knitr/blob/3237add034368a3018ff26fa9f4d0ca89a4afd78/R/hooks-extra.R#L74)):

```r
embed_svg_fonts <- function(before, options, envir) {
  # !before means after the chunk is run
  if (!before) {
    # Get a list of all the plot files this chunk makes
    paths <- knitr:::get_plot_files()

    # Loop through all the plot files. When dealing with SVG, knitr actually
    # creates two different files: an initial DVI and the converted SVG. We'll
    # use the original DVI and pass it through dvisvgm again, this time with
    # --font-format=woff enabled. This will overwrite the SVG that knitr makes
    knitr:::in_base_dir(
      lapply(paths, function(x) {
        message("Embedding fonts in ", x)
        path_svg <- xfun::with_ext(x, "svg")
        path_dvi <- xfun::with_ext(x, "dvi")
        
        if (system2('dvisvgm', c('--font-format=woff', '-o', shQuote(path_svg), shQuote(path_dvi))) != 0)
          stop('Failed to convert ', path_dvi, ' to ', path_svg)
      })
    )
  }
}

# Register the function as a possible hook
# Use this in a chunk by setting embed_svg_fonts=TRUE in the chunk options
knitr::knit_hooks$set(embed_svg_fonts = embed_svg_fonts)
```

Stick that ↑ in an invisible chunk (probably in the same one with `Sys.setenv(LIBGS = "blah")`), and then add `embed_svg_fonts=TRUE` to the chunk options of the TikZ chunk, and it should work. When you knit, you'll see two messages about converting DVI to SVG. We don't care about the first—that's **knitr**'s basic version without embedded fonts. The second message corresponds to the command we created with the hook, which includes `--font-format=woff`.

Here's what the SVG file looks like now with the fonts embedded in it ([see full SVG file here](dag-text-1.svg)):

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="40%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("dag-text-1.svg")
```

## tl;dr: Final working version

Here's what your final R Markdown file should look like:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/andrewheiss/55f06b079cb7064f2de5b2c174546fae.js?file=example-final.Rmd"></script>

When knitting to PDF, the TikZ figure will show up as a regular PDF image, as excepted. When knitting to HTML, though, **knitr** will create a DVI version of the image and then convert that to SVG (but without font embedding enabled in `dvisvgm`). Then finally, because of the post-rendering hook, **knitr** will run the `embed_svg_fonts()` function on the DVI and create a new SVG with fonts embedded that will overwrite the original SVG file. 

Look at that! So great! ([see full HTML file here](example-final.html)):

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="70%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("example-final.png")
```
