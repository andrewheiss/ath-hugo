As of November 16, 2020, I'm spending all my time on these things:

* Staying at home pretty much 24/7 because of the COVID-19 pandemic
* Raising 5 kids (13, 11, 8.5, 5.5, 3) and trying to stay sane ([family blog](http://www.heissatopia.com/))
* Settling into Atlanta as I start a new job as an assistant professor in the [Department of Public Management and Policy](https://aysps.gsu.edu/public-management-policy/) at the [Andrew Young School of Policy Studies](https://aysps.gsu.edu/) at [Georgia State University](https://www.gsu.edu/)
* Teaching [data visualization](https://datavizm20.classes.andrewheiss.com/), [program evaluation](https://evalsf20.classes.andrewheiss.com/), and [microeconomics](https://econf20.classes.andrewheiss.com/) at the [Andrew Young School of Policy Studies](https://aysps.gsu.edu/) at [Georgia State University](https://www.gsu.edu/) during the 2020â€“21 academic year
* Converting my dissertation into multiple articles and sending them out to journals + continuing [my research on authoritarianism and international NGOs](https://www.ingoresearch.org/)
