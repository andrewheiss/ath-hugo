Since my last two blog posts on [binary and continuous inverse probability weights (IPWs)](https://www.andrewheiss.com/blog/2020/12/01/ipw-binary-continuous/) and [marginal structural models (MSMs) for time-series cross-sectional (TSCS) panel data](https://www.andrewheiss.com/blog/2020/12/03/ipw-tscs-msm/), I've spent a ton of time trying to figure out why I couldn't recover the exact causal effect I had built in to those examples when using panel data. It was a mystery, and it took weeks to figure out what was happening. 

After poring through all sorts of articles on MSMs and TSCS data like @ThoemmesOng:2016 and @BlackwellGlynn:2018, along with all sorts of articles on the differences between [generalized estimating equations (GEEs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_estimating_equation), which the epidemiology world (and everyone who does MSMs) seems to love, and multilevel models (which I find a lot more intuitive, and which can be done Bayesianly with **brms**), I *finally* figured out what was wrong and how to calculate correct IPWs for panel data.

The main issue lies in the synthetic data I had created for those earlier blog posts. [There, I used the **fabricatr** package to create a country-year panel](https://www.andrewheiss.com/blog/2020/12/03/ipw-tscs-msm/#simulated-time-series-cross-sectional-data), which seemed correct and great. However, it didn't exactly match the data-generating process in situations where the value in one time period (like $X_t$) depends on the value from the previous time period (or $X_{t-1}$), or autocorrelation. As such, I couldn't quite get the correct causal effects out (since the data didn't show interdepdency across time). 

After lots of struggle, though, I finally figured out a way to explicitly build this autocorrelation in. And thanks to this delightfully accessible article by @ThoemmesOng:2016 ([ungated free version here](https://anthonyongphd.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/emerging-adulthood-2016-thoemmes-40-59.pdf)), I found clear code for MSMs that I could expand to test on more complex panel data. 

In this post, I'll do a few things: (1) recreate the two-time-period example from Thoemmes and Ong's appendix (which is stuck in a PDF and really hard to copy/paste out), (2) redo their two-period example with a tidier approach, and (3) expand their two-period approach to multiple years and replace GEEs with multilevel models.

Here we go!

## Synthetic data overview

In their paper, Thoemmes and Ong create simulated data based on this DAG, with a time-varying treatment, a non-time-varying confounder, and a time-varying outcome (depression):

```{r depression-dag, fig.height=2.5, fig.asp=NULL}
# I generally prefer the easier-to-read formula syntax in dagify() (i.e. D1 ~ T1
# + C, etc.), but it doesn't work with subscripted numbers like T[1], so we have
# to use this dagitty syntax instead
depression_dag <- dagitty('dag {
"C" [pos="2.5,2"]
"T[1]" [pos="1,1"]
"D[1]" [pos="2,1"]
"T[2]" [pos="3,1"]
"D[2]" [pos="4,1"]
"C" -> "D[1]"
"C" -> "D[2]"
"C" -> "T[1]"
"C" -> "T[2]"
"D[1]" -> "T[2]"
"T[1]" -> "D[1]"
"T[2]" -> "D[2]"
}') %>% 
  tidy_dagitty()

ggplot(depression_dag, aes(x = x, y = y, xend = xend, yend = yend)) +
  geom_dag_edges() +
  geom_dag_point(color = "grey80", size = 12) +
  geom_dag_text(color = "black", size = 5, parse = TRUE) +
  theme_dag()
```

Essentially earlier treatment ($T_1$) causes some level of depression ($D_1$), which causes later treatment ($T_2$), which causes later depression ($D_2$). This whole chain is influenced by some non-varying confounder ($C$).

## Original two-period Thoemmes and Ong results

Here's the original code from the appendix of @ThoemmesOng:2016 for data with a time-varying continuous treatment and a confounder. It explicitly creates columns for `t1`, `d1`, `t2`, and `d2`, so it is easy to mathematically make it so that `t2` is caused by `d1`.

Because it's only two time periods, they calculate the inverse probability weights in two formulas and then multiply them together:

- Weights for the first time period:

    $$
    w_1 = \frac{\phi(T_{i1})}{\phi(T_{i1}\ |\ C)}
    $$

- Weights for the second time period:

    $$
    w_2 = \frac{\phi(T_{i2}\ |\ T_{i1})}{\phi(T_{i2}\ |\ C, T_{i1}, D_{i1})}
    $$

- Final weights:

    $$
    w = w_1 \cdot w_2
    $$

Here's their code:

tw2 <- ifelse(w > quantile(w, probs = .99), quantile(w, probs = 0.99), tw2)
```

They they run a bunch of different outcome models with `geeglm()`:

```{r original-models}
only_t1 <- geeglm(d2 ~ t1, data = df1, id = rownames(df1))
only_t2 <- geeglm(d2 ~ t2, data = df1, id = rownames(df1))
both_t <- geeglm(d2 ~ t1 + t2, data = df1, id = rownames(df1))
both_t_c <- geeglm(d2 ~ t1 + t2 + c + d1, data = df1, id = rownames(df1))

stab_ipw <- geeglm(d2 ~ t1 + t2, data = df1, id = rownames(df1), weights = w)
stab_ipw_1p <- geeglm(d2 ~ t1 + t2, data = df1, id = rownames(df1), weights = tw2)
stab_ipw_5p <- geeglm(d2 ~ t1 + t2, data = df1, id = rownames(df1), weights = tw1)

results <- tribble(
  ~`Method`, ~`T<sub>1</sub> effect`, ~`T<sub>2</sub> effect`,
  "True effect", 0.160, 0.400,
  "Naive, only T1", filter(tidy(only_t1), term == "t1")$estimate, NA,
  "Naive, only T2", NA, filter(tidy(only_t2), term == "t2")$estimate,
  "Naive, both", filter(tidy(both_t), term == "t1")$estimate, filter(tidy(both_t), term == "t2")$estimate,
  "Naive, both + controls", filter(tidy(both_t_c), term == "t1")$estimate, filter(tidy(both_t_c), term == "t2")$estimate,

  "IPW, 5% truncated", filter(tidy(stab_ipw_5p), term == "t1")$estimate, filter(tidy(stab_ipw_5p), term == "t2")$estimate
)
```

```{r original-results-table, echo=FALSE}
kbl(results, digits = 3, format = "html", table.attr = "style='width:70%;'", escape = FALSE) %>% 
  kable_styling(htmltable_class = "pure-table pure-table-horizontal")
```

And here's all that compared to what they have in the paper:

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("ThoemmesOng-Table2.png")
```

It's identical! I'm chalking any tiny differences up to the fact that `set.seed()` changed with R 4.0 and they used R 3.x in their paper. (Also the T2-only model is wrong, but that's probably a typo—the "estimated scale parameter" from that model is 0.574 with an sd of 0.018, which lines up perfectly with the coefficient in the published table, so I think maybe the published paper has the wrong number in the table.)

Also, there seems to be another typo in that table. The true effect of T1 in the table is 0.140, but in the text of the paper, it says the effect should be 0.160, which makes sense—that's the product of 0.4 × 0.4, or each of the treatment coefficients ($0.4 \times 0.4 = 0.16$).

Regardless of those super tiny insignificant typos, we did it! We have their exact results using marginal structural models and inverse probability weights.


## Tidier two-period results

The code to generate that data isn't very tidyverse-friendly and it creates a ton of intermediate vectors. Here's a cleaner version with **dplyr**:

```{r original-dplyr}
set.seed(12345)
n <- 2000

df_nice <- tibble(id = 1:n,
                  c = rnorm(n, 0, 1)) %>% 
  mutate(t1 = (0.1 * c) + rnorm(n, 0, sqrt(0.99)),
         d1 = (0.1 * c) + (0.4 * t1) + rnorm(n, 0, sqrt(0.822)),
         t2 = (0.1 * c) + (0.4 * d1) + (0.4 * t1) + rnorm(n, 0, sqrt(0.5196)),
         d2 = (0.1 * c) + (0.4 * t2) + (0.4 * d1) + rnorm(n, 0, sqrt(0.4582)))
```

Also, this original data is wide, with explicit columns for each time period. Let's make it tidy and pretend the time periods are years (`y`) and add some lagged columns:

```{r original-tidy}
df_tidy <- df_nice %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = c(t1, d1, t2, d2)) %>% 
  separate(name, into = c("variable", "y"), sep = 1) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = "variable", values_from = "value") %>% 
  group_by(id) %>% 
  mutate(across(c(t, d), list(lag = lag))) %>% 
  ungroup()
head(df_tidy)
```

This is how panel data is typically structured, with rows repeated for each time period. This is good because we can figure out how to structure the weight models and outcome model in a way that uses this structure and compare it to the original `t1`, `d1`, etc. models. 

Because there are only two time periods, the lagged columns here are missing a ton of data (since you can't see what the value is for year 0), but it'll still work.

With the data like this, we can find the weights. We'll do it both manually and with the **ipw** package.

Manually, we need to fit two models (a numerator and denominator) and then take the cumulative product of their probability distributions:

$$
w = \prod^t_{t = 1} \frac{\phi(T_{it} | T_{i, t-1}, C_i)}{\phi(T_{it} | T_{i, t-1}, D_{i, t-1}, C_i)}
$$

Here we go!

```{r find-tidy-weights}
# Remove NAs since ipwpoint() will complain
df_tidy_sans_na <- df_tidy %>%
  filter(!is.na(t_lag))

# Manually
# Numerator is lagged treatment + non-varying confounders
model_num <- lm(t ~ t_lag + c,
                data = df_tidy_sans_na)

# Denominator is lagged treatment, lagged outcome, time-varying confounders +
# non-varying confounders
model_denom <- lm(t ~ t_lag + d_lag + c, 
                  data = df_tidy_sans_na)

# Probability distributions
num <- dnorm(df_tidy_sans_na$t,
             predict(model_num),
             sd(residuals(model_num)))

den <- dnorm(df_tidy_sans_na$t,
             predict(model_denom),
             sd(residuals(model_denom)))

# Make num/den fraction and find cumulative product within each id
df_weights_manual <- df_tidy_sans_na %>% 
  mutate(weights_no_time = num / den) %>% 
  group_by(id) %>% 
  mutate(ipw = cumprod(weights_no_time)) %>% 
  ungroup()

# Automatically find weights with ipw::ipwpoint()
tidy_weights_auto <- ipwpoint(
  exposure = t,
  family = "gaussian", 
  numerator = ~ t_lag + c, 
  denominator = ~ t_lag + d_lag + c, 
  data = as.data.frame(df_tidy_sans_na))

df_weights_auto <- df_tidy_sans_na %>% 
  mutate(ipw = tidy_weights_auto$ipw.weights)
```

Now we can use these new weights in the outcome model:

```{r tidier-models}
model_lags_manual <- geeglm(d ~ t + t_lag, data = df_weights_manual,
                            id = id, weights = ipw)

model_lags_auto <- geeglm(d ~ t + t_lag, data = df_weights_auto, 
                          id = id, weights = ipw)

results <- tribble(
  ~`Method`, ~`T<sub>1</sub> effect`, ~`T<sub>2</sub> effect`,
  "True effect", 0.160, 0.400,
  "IPW, original", filter(tidy(stab_ipw), term == "t1")$estimate, filter(tidy(stab_ipw), term == "t2")$estimate,
  "IPW, lagged, manual", filter(tidy(model_lags_manual), term == "t_lag")$estimate, filter(tidy(model_lags_manual), term == "t")$estimate,
  "IPW, lagged, automatic", filter(tidy(model_lags_auto), term == "t_lag")$estimate, filter(tidy(model_lags_auto), term == "t")$estimate
) %>% 
  mutate(across(2:3, ~sprintf("%.3f", round(., 3)))) %>% 
  add_row(`T<sub>1</sub> effect` = "<b>lag(T) effect</b>", 
          `T<sub>2</sub> effect` = "<b>T effect</b>", 
          .after = 2)
```

```{r show-tidier-results, echo=FALSE}
kbl(results, format = "html", table.attr = "style='width:70%;'", escape = FALSE) %>% 
  kable_styling(htmltable_class = "pure-table pure-table-horizontal")
```

Those results aren't identical (I don't know why!), but they're close-ish, so whatever. It worked! Instead of using explicit `t1`, `d1`, etc. columns, we can do the same marginal structural model with just `t` and `d` in a long data frame.


## Expansion to multiple-period data

Since that's all working, now we can do something a little/lot trickier—instead of manually specifying $T_1$ and $T_2$, which isn't really easily scalable to more time periods, we'll construct the data more generally for any number of years

### Tricky interdependent data generating process

The trick here is that we want to have any number of time periods, but also maintain the same DAG relationships. In the small data, these are the two general relationships:

- $\text{treatment}_t = (0.1 \cdot \text{confounder}) + (0.4 \cdot \text{depression}_{t-1}) + (0.4 \cdot \text{treatment}_{t-1}) + \text{noise}$
- $\text{depression}_t = (0.1 \cdot \text{confounder}) + (0.4 \cdot \text{treatment}_{t}) + (0.4 \cdot \text{depression}_{t-1}) + \text{noise}$

Or in code:

- `t = (0.1 * c) + (0.4 * lag(d)) + (0.4 * lag(t)) + rnorm(n, 0, sqrt(0.5196))`
- `d = (0.1 * c) + (0.4 * t) + (0.4 * lag(d)) + rnorm(n, 0, sqrt(0.4582))`

Generating this data in a tidy **dplyr** way is super tricky, since the `t` and `d` columns are interdependent—the data has to be generated rowwise, but we also have to be able to look back a row to get the lagged values of `t` and `d`. I've seen people like @BlackwellGlynn:2018 get around this by using a `for` loop to build the data, but I have an aversion to for loops in R [since **purrr** exists](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/iteration.html#for-loops-vs.-functionals), so I spent way too much time trying to figure out a **purrr**-based way to do this. Others have tried this (like [this RStudio Community post](https://community.rstudio.com/t/row-wise-iteration-in-a-dataframe-with-interdependent-variables/38778)), and I [asked about it on Twitter](https://twitter.com/andrewheiss/status/1347780639714664448), where I got a few cool solutions using `purrr::accumulate()` and `purrr::reduce()`, like [this fancy `accumutate()` function from Ian Moran](https://twitter.com/ianmoran011/status/1347849678696574977) and [these solutions from Miles McBain](https://gist.github.com/andrewheiss/89ae26a7a4682aff0ee9b7db1e92c326#gistcomment-3587810). 

There are no loops involved in those solutions, but phew that accumulate/reduce syntax is wonky and I can't fully wrap my head around it (plus it makes it hard to carry over non-accumulated variables). So I resorted to a loop. Oooof.

It works, though! Let's test it on just one ID. We'll generate just one row with `t1`, `t2`, `d1`, and `d2`, and we'll remove the noise from each of the columns:

```{r}
set.seed(12345)
n <- 1

# Remove all noise so that we can compare this with the function version
df_example <- tibble(id = 1:n,
                     c = rnorm(n, 0, 1)) %>% 
  mutate(t1 = (0.1 * c),
         d1 = (0.1 * c) + (0.4 * t1),
         t2 = (0.1 * c) + (0.4 * d1) + (0.4 * t1),
         d2 = (0.1 * c) + (0.4 * t2) + (0.4 * d1))
df_example
```

This isn't tidy data, so technically there are two years here. We'll keep `t1` and `d1` as the initial values for year 1, then generate values for 5 years. If we do this right, the `t` and `d` values for year 2 should be identical to `t2` and `d2` here.

```{r example-loop}
# Add a bunch of extra years with empty cells for t and d
df_multiple_years_empty <- df_example %>% 
  mutate(y = 1) %>% 
  select(id, y, t = t1, d = d1, c) %>% 
  add_row(y = 2:5) %>% 
  # c doesn't vary across time
  mutate(id = 1, 
         c = df_example$c[1])
df_multiple_years_empty

# Now we need to build the interdependent values for t and d with <gasp> a loop
#
# The loop is inside this function---it skips the initial row and then
# iteratively adds new rows. We can't use neat things like lag(t), so instead
# we use df$t[i - 1]
# 
# We omit the extra noise for now
dgp <- function(df) {
  for (i in 2:nrow(df)) {
    df$t[i] <- (0.1 * df$c[i]) + (0.4 * df$d[i - 1]) + (0.4 * df$t[i - 1])
    df$d[i] <- (0.1 * df$c[i]) + (0.4 * df$t[i]) + (0.4 * df$d[i - 1])
  }
  
  df
}

# Generate all 5 years
df_multiple_years_empty %>% 
  dgp()
```

If this worked, the `t` and `d` values for year 2 should be the same as `t2` and `d2` here:

```{r check-example-loop}
df_example
```

They are!

Since we know it works, let's generate a big dataset for playing with multi-year MSMs, this time with noise:

```{r big-msm-data}
set.seed(1234)

# Make data for the first year
df_first_year <- expand_grid(id = 1:2000, y = 1) %>% 
  mutate(c = rnorm(n(), 0, 1),
         t = (0.1 * c) + rnorm(n(), 0, sqrt(0.99)),
         d = (0.1 * c) + (0.4 * t) + rnorm(n(), 0, sqrt(0.822)))
df_first_year

# Add empty years 2-5
df_panel_empty <- df_first_year %>% 
  bind_rows(expand_grid(id = 1:2000, y = 2:5)) %>% 
  arrange(id, y)
head(df_panel_empty, 10)

# Add noise to the fancy dgp() function
dgp <- function(df) {
  for (i in 2:nrow(df)) {
    df$t[i] <- (0.1 * df$c[i]) + (0.4 * df$d[i - 1]) + (0.4 * df$t[i - 1]) + rnorm(1, 0, sqrt(0.5196))
    df$d[i] <- (0.1 * df$c[i]) + (0.4 * df$t[i]) + (0.4 * df$d[i - 1]) + rnorm(1, 0, sqrt(0.4582))
  }
  
  df
}

# Run dgp() within each id
df_panel <- df_panel_empty %>% 
  group_by(id) %>% 
  # This doesn't vary with time, so repeat it across all the years
  mutate(c = c[1]) %>% 
  # Nest the data into a single cell in each row
  nest() %>% 
  # Run dgp() on the nested cell (in a column named "data")
  mutate(dgp = map(data, dgp)) %>% 
  select(-data) %>% 
  # Unnest the nested dgp()-ed cells
  unnest(dgp) %>% 
  # Add some lags
  mutate(across(c(t, d), list(lag = lag))) %>% 
  ungroup()
head(df_panel, 10)
```

### Multiple-period marginal structural models

Cool cool cool. We have multi-period data where variables depend on their lagged values and other interdependent columns. Let's build some MSMs!

We're going to build weights two different ways here. Because the data has a time-series cross-sectional structure (with multiple individuals across multiple years), the weight models need to account for that structure. Everywhere I've seen elsewhere uses generalized estimating equations (GEEs) for these models (and that's what the **ipw** package uses behind the scenes), but I'm a fan of multilevel models, so I'll make weights with both to compare their results.

We'll use the same equation as before—the cumulative product of the ratio of two probability distributions:

$$
w = \prod^t_{t = 1} \frac{\phi(T_{it} | T_{i, t-1}, C_i)}{\phi(T_{it} | T_{i, t-1}, D_{i, t-1}, C_i)}

Now we can build the outcome models, using both GEE and multilevel models.

```{r panel-outcome-models}
m_manual_gee <- geeglm(d ~ t + t_lag, 
                       data = df_panel_weights_manual,
                       id = id, waves = y, 
                       weights = ipw_gee)

m_auto_gee <- geeglm(d ~ t + t_lag, 
                     data = df_panel_weights_auto, 
                     id = id, waves = y, 
                     weights = ipw)

m_lmer_manual_gee_wt <- lmer(d ~ t + t_lag + (1 | id), 
                             data = df_panel_weights_manual, 
                             weights = ipw_gee)

m_lmer_auto_gee_wt <- lmer(d ~ t + t_lag + (1 | id), 
                           data = df_panel_weights_auto, 
                           weights = ipw)

m_lmer_manual_multi_wt <- lmer(d ~ t + t_lag + (1 | id), 
                               data = df_panel_weights_manual, 
                               weights = ipw_multi)

results <- tribble(
  ~`Method`, ~`Weights`, ~`lag(T) effect`, ~`T effect`,
  "True effect", NA, 0.160, 0.400,
  "Panel with GEE", "Manual GEE weights", filter(tidy(m_manual_gee), term == "t_lag")$estimate, filter(tidy(m_manual_gee), term == "t")$estimate,
  "Panel with GEE", "Automatic GEE weights", filter(tidy(m_auto_gee), term == "t_lag")$estimate, filter(tidy(m_auto_gee), term == "t")$estimate,
  "Panel with multilevel model", "Manual GEE weights", filter(tidy(m_lmer_manual_gee_wt), term == "t_lag")$estimate, filter(tidy(m_lmer_manual_gee_wt), term == "t")$estimate,
  "Panel with multilevel model", "Automatic GEE weights", filter(tidy(m_lmer_auto_gee_wt), term == "t_lag")$estimate, filter(tidy(m_lmer_auto_gee_wt), term == "t")$estimate,
  "Panel with multilevel model", "Manual multilevel weights", filter(tidy(m_lmer_manual_multi_wt), term == "t_lag")$estimate, filter(tidy(m_lmer_manual_multi_wt), term == "t")$estimate
)
```

```{r show-panel-results, echo=FALSE}
kbl(results, digits = 3, format = "html", table.attr = "style='width:90%;'") %>% 
  kable_styling(htmltable_class = "pure-table pure-table-horizontal")
```

Phew.

All of the models here are relatively close to the true effect for $T_t$! (Though they're all sizably off for $T_{t-1}$, but I don't know why). 

Importantly, it seems that mixed models work just fine for both weights and outcome models, which means there's probably no need to use GEE (and this can all be done Bayesianly with `brms()`!). 

It works!


## Questions for the future

I still have some lingering things to check (forthcoming in a future blog post):

- `y` isn't any any of the models: weights numerator, weights denominator, or outcome. If I include it in any of the models, the there's perfect fit. That may be because there are no time-varying confounders? I think year might need to be in there somewhere, but I'm not sure. @BlackwellGlynn:2018 include year in the numerator and denominator for weights in their Swank Steinmo replication, but not in their Burgoon replication.

- This example has no time-varying confounders. I need to see how this all works with those.

- This DAG for this example is pretty simple. I need to see what happens when there are *also* direct arrows from $T_{t-1} \rightarrow T_{t}$ and $D_{t-1} \rightarrow D_{t}$.
